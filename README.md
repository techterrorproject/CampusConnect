**Project Name: CampusConnect**

**CampusConnect** is a simple social media web platform built for everyone inside the DIU Campus â€” **students, teachers, and staff**.  
Itâ€™s our Web Engineering course project, designed to bring all campus communication, updates, and sharing into one place.

## ðŸ“Œ Why we built CampusConnect

In most universities, updates and information are scattered across Facebook groups, WhatsApp chats, Telegram groups, printed notices, or word of mouth.  
We wanted to build something just for our campus community â€” where everyone can easily:

- Share updates, notes, and announcements
- Discover and join clubs
- See what events are happening
- Help each other by sharing study materials

CampusConnect keeps all this in a single, easy-to-use platform.
